If $f:[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] \\rightarrow[2,3,4,5,1,7,8,6,9,10]$, then $f$ has one cycle of period 5 and one cycle of period 3 , so the period of $f$ is 15 .

So $s_{1}=s_{0}$, and for all $n, s_{n}=s_{n+1}$; in short, the period of $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ is just 1 .\n\nIn order for $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ to have a period greater than $1, f$ must be many-to-one, so that some values occur more than once (and some values do not occur at all) in the sum $f(1)+f(2)+\\cdots+f(10)$ (or, in the original problem, $f(1)+f(2)+\\cdots+f(20)$ ). For example, consider the function $f_{2}$ below:\n\n$$\nf_{2}:[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] \\rightarrow[2,3,4,5,1,10,9,10,7,3]\n$$\n\nNote that $s_{1}=2+3+4+5+1+10+9+10+7+3 \\neq 55$, so $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ is not immediately periodic. But $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ is eventually periodic, as the following argument shows. The function $f_{2}$ has two cycles: $1 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow 3 \\rightarrow 4 \\rightarrow 5 \\rightarrow 1$, and $7 \\rightarrow 9 \\rightarrow 7$. There are also two paths that meet up with the first cycle: $6 \\rightarrow 10 \\rightarrow 3 \\rightarrow \\cdots$ and $8 \\rightarrow 10 \\rightarrow 3 \\rightarrow \\cdots$. Thus for all $k$ in $T, f_{2}\\left(f_{2}(k)\\right)$ is an element of one of these two extended cycles. Thus $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ eventually becomes periodic.\n\nThe criterion that the function be many-to-one is necessary, but not sufficient, for $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ to have period greater than 1 . To see why, consider the function $g:[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] \\rightarrow$ $[2,3,4,5,6,1,8,7,8,7]$. This function is many-to-one, and contains two cycles, $1 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow$ $3 \\rightarrow 4 \\rightarrow 5 \\rightarrow 6 \\rightarrow 1$ and $7 \\rightarrow 8 \\rightarrow 7$. But because $g(9)=8$ and $g(10)=7$, the sum $s_{1}=2+3+4+5+6+1+8+7+8+7$, while $s_{2}=3+4+5+6+1+2+7+8+7+8$. In fact, for $n>1, s_{n+1}=s_{n}$, because applying $f$ only permutes the 6 -cycle and switches the two 7 's and two 8's. That is, in the list $\\underbrace{(g \\circ \\cdots \\circ g)}_{n}(1), \\ldots, \\underbrace{(g \\circ \\cdots \\circ g)}_{n}(10)$, the values 7 and 8 both show up exactly twice. This cycle is balanced: each of its elements shows up the same number of times for all $n$ in the list $\\underbrace{(g \\circ \\cdots \\circ g)}_{n}(1), \\ldots, \\underbrace{(g \\circ \\cdots \\circ g)}_{n}(10)$, for all $n$ after a certain point. The conclusion is that not all many-to-one functions produce unbalanced cycles.\n\nThere are two ways a function $g$ can produce balanced cycles. First, the cycles can be selfcontained, so no element outside of the cycle is ever absorbed into the cycle, as happens with the 6-cycle in the example above. Alternatively, the outside elements that are absorbed into a cycle can all arrive at different points of the cycle, so that each element of the cycle occurs equally often in each iteration of $g$. In the example above, the values $g(9)=7$ and $g(10)=8$ balance the $7 \\rightarrow 8 \\rightarrow 7$ cycle. On the other hand, in the function $f_{2}$ above, $f(f(6))=f(f(8))=f(f(1))=3$, making the large cycle unbalanced: in $s_{2}$, the value 3 appears three times in $s_{2}$, but the value 2 only appears once in $s_{2}$.\n\nThe foregoing shows that only unbalanced cycles can affect the periodicity of $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$. Because each element of a balanced cycle occurs equally often in each iteration, the period of that component of the sum $s_{n}$ attributed to the cycle is simply 1. (The case where $f$ is a permutation of $S$ is simply a special case of this result.) In the above example, the large cycle is\n\n\n\nunbalanced. Note the following results under $f_{2}$.\n\n| $n$ | $\\overbrace{\\left(f_{2} \\circ \\cdots \\circ f_{2}\\right)}^{n}(T)$ | $s_{n}$ |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| 1 | $[2,3,4,5,1,10,9,10,7,3]$ | 54 |\n| 2 | $[3,4,5,1,2,3,7,3,9,4]$ | 41 |\n| 3 | $[4,5,1,2,3,4,9,4,7,5]$ | 40 |\n| 4 | $[5,1,2,3,4,5,7,5,9,1]$ | 42 |\n| 5 | $[1,2,3,4,5,1,9,1,7,2]$ | 35 |\n| 6 | $[2,3,4,5,1,2,7,2,9,3]$ | 38 |\n| 7 | $[3,4,5,1,2,3,9,3,7,4]$ | 41 |\n| 8 | $[4,5,1,2,3,4,7,4,9,5]$ | 40 |\n| 9 | $[5,1,2,3,4,5,9,5,7,1]$ | 42 |\n\nThe period of $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ for $f_{2}$ is 5 , the period of the unbalanced cycle.\n\nThe interested reader may inquire whether all unbalanced cycles affect the periodicity of $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$; we encourage those readers to explore the matter independently. For the purposes of solving this problem, it is sufficient to note that unbalanced cycles can affect $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ 's periodicity.\n\nFinally, note that an unbalanced $k$-cycle actually requires at least $k+1$ elements: $k$ to form the cycle, plus at least 1 to be absorbed into the cycle and cause the imbalance. For the original set $S$, one way to create such an imbalance would be to have $f(20)=f(1)=$ $2, f(2)=3, f(3)=4, \\ldots, f(19)=1$. This arrangement creates an unbalanced cycle of length 19. But breaking up into smaller unbalanced cycles makes it possible to increase the period of $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ even more, because then in most cases the period is the least common multiple of the periods of the unbalanced cycles. For example, $f:[1,2,3, \\ldots, 20]=$ $[2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,1,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,11,11,11]$ has an unbalanced cycle of length 9 and an unbalanced cycle of length 8 , giving $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ a period of 72 .\n\nSo the goal is to maximize $\\operatorname{lcm}\\left\\{k_{1}, k_{2}, \\ldots, k_{m}\\right\\}$ such that $k_{1}+k_{2}+\\cdots+k_{m}+m \\leq 20$. With $m=2$, the maximal period is 72 , achieved with $k_{1}=9$ and $k_{2}=8$. With $m=3$, $k_{1}+k_{2}+k_{3} \\leq 17$, but $\\operatorname{lcm}\\{7,6,4\\}=84<\\operatorname{lcm}\\{7,5,4\\}=140$. This last result can be obtained with unbalanced cycles of length 4,5 , and 7 , with the remaining four points entering the three cycles (or with one point forming a balanced cycle of length 1, i.e., a fixed point). Choosing larger values of $m$ decreases the values of $k$ so far that they no longer form long cycles: when $m=4, k_{1}+k_{2}+k_{3}+k_{4} \\leq 16$, and even if $k_{4}=2, k_{3}=3$, and $k_{2}=5$, for a period of 30 , the largest possible value of $k_{1}=6$, which does not alter the period. (Even $k_{1}=7, k_{2}=5$, and $k_{3}=k_{4}=2$ only yields a period of 70 .) Thus the maximum period of $s_{n}$ is $\\mathbf{1 4 0}$. One such function $f$ is given below.\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|cccccccccccccccccccc}\nn & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 11 & 12 & 13 & 14 & 15 & 16 & 17 & 18 & 19 & 20 \\\\\n\\hline f(n) & 2 & 3 & 4 & 1 & 1 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 6 & 6 & 13 & 14 & 15 & 16 & 17 & 18 & 12 & 12 & 20\n\\end{array}\n$$"

Exactly one number in such a sequence will be a multiple of 5 , but that number could also be a multiple of 2 and hence share a common factor with at least one other number in the sequence. There are several cases to consider, namely whether the sequence starts with an even number or an odd number.\n\nIf the sequence starts with an even number, then the second and fourth numbers are both odd, and at least one of them is not a multiple of 3 and hence is relatively prime to all other numbers in the sequence because it is neither a multiple of 2 nor 3 and hence is at least 5 away from the nearest integer with a common factor.

At most one of these is divisible by 3 , and at most one is divisible by 5 , so one of the odd numbers must be divisible by neither 3 nor 5 . This odd number differs by at most 6 from each other element of the sequence, so the only prime factors it can share with another element of the sequence are 2, 3, and 5 .

A list with fewer than four numbers cannot produce a median and unique mode that are distinct from each other. To see this, first note that a list with one number has the same median and mode. In a list with two numbers, the mode is not unique if the numbers are different, and if the numbers are the same, the median and mode are equal. In a list of three numbers with a unique mode, the mode must occur twice. Hence the\n\n\n\nmode is equal to the middle number of the three, which is the median. Thus a list with a median and unique mode that are different from each other must contain at least four numbers.\n\nNow suppose that a list satisfying the given conditions sums to less than 12 . The mean must be greater than 1, and because the list contains at least four numbers, the mean must be exactly 2 . The median must also be greater than 1 , and if the mode is 4 , then the sum must be greater than 12 . Thus it remains to determine if a mean of 2 with mode 1 and median 3 can be achieved with a list of four or five positive integers.

        "solution": [
            "Proceed in two steps: first, determine the possible sets of side lengths for the squares; then determine which arrangement of squares produces the largest perimeter. Let the side lengths of the squares be positive integers $m \\geq n \\geq p$. Then $m^{2}+n^{2}+p^{2}=41$, so $m \\leq 6$, and because $3^{2}+3^{2}+3^{2}<41$, it follows that $m>3$. If $m=6$, then $n^{2}+p^{2}=5$, so $n=2$ and $p=1$. If $m=5$, then $n^{2}+p^{2}=16$, which has no positive integral solutions. If $m=4$, then $n^{2}+p^{2}=25$, which is possible if $n=4$ and $p=3$. So the two possible sets of values are $m=6, n=2, p=1$ or $m=4, n=4, p=3$.\n\nFirst consider $m=6, n=2, p=1$. Moving counterclockwise around the origin, one square is between the other two; by symmetry, it suffices to consider only the three possibilities for this \"middle\" square. If the middle square is the 6-square, then each of the other two squares has a side that is a subset of a side of the 6 -square. To compute the total perimeter, add the perimeters of the three squares and subtract twice the lengths of the shared segments (because they contribute 0 to the perimeter). Thus the total perimeter is $4 \\cdot 6+4 \\cdot 2+4 \\cdot 1-2 \\cdot 2-2 \\cdot 1=30$. If the middle square is the 2 -square, then one of its sides is a subset of the 6 -square's side, and one of its sides is a superset of the 1 -square's side, for a total perimeter of $4 \\cdot 6+4 \\cdot 2+4 \\cdot 1-2 \\cdot 2-2 \\cdot 1=$ 30. But if the middle square is the 1-square, then two of its sides are subsets of the other squares' sides, and the total perimeter is $4 \\cdot 6+4 \\cdot 2+4 \\cdot 1-2 \\cdot 1-2 \\cdot 1=32$.\n\nIf $m=4, n=4$, and $p=3$, similar logic to the foregoing suggests that the maximal perimeter is obtained when the smallest square is between the other two, yielding a total perimeter of $4 \\cdot 4+4 \\cdot 4+4 \\cdot 3-2 \\cdot 3-2 \\cdot 3=32$. Either of the other two arrangements yields a total perimeter of $4 \\cdot 4+4 \\cdot 4+4 \\cdot 3-2 \\cdot 3-2 \\cdot 4=30$. So the maximum perimeter is $\\mathbf{3 2}$.",
            "Let the side lengths be $a, b$, and $c$, and let $P$ be the perimeter. If the $a \\times a$ square is placed in between the other two (going either clockwise or counterclockwise around the origin), then\n\n$$\nP=3 b+|b-a|+2 a+|c-a|+3 c \\text {. }\n$$\n\nTo obtain a more symmetric expression, note that for any real numbers $x$ and $y$,\n\n$$\n|x-y|=\\max \\{x, y\\}-\\min \\{x, y\\}=x+y-2 \\min \\{x, y\\}\n$$\n\nUsing this identity,\n\n$$\nP=4 a+4 b+4 c-2 \\min \\{a, b\\}-2 \\min \\{a, c\\} .\n$$\n\nThus $P$ is the sum of the perimeters of the three, less twice the overlaps.

Thus the largest possible value of $p+q$ is $83+79=\\mathbf{1 6 2}$."

All members of the sequence are determined by the initial values $c_{0}$ and $c_{1}$, which can be computed by substituting 0 and 1 for $n$ in the expression $\\alpha^{n}+\\beta^{n}$, yielding $c_{0}=(3+\\sqrt{5})^{0}+(3-\\sqrt{5})^{0}=2$, and $c_{1}=(3+\\sqrt{5})^{1}+(3-\\sqrt{5})^{1}=6$.

First, each such term has the form $\\left(\\begin{array}{l}34 \\\\ 2 k\\end{array}\\right) 3^{34-2 k} 5^{k}$, where $2 \\leq k \\leq 15$.\n\nThus it is enough to show that the binomial coefficient is even. Because $\\left(\\begin{array}{l}34 \\\\ 2 k\\end{array}\\right)=\\left(\\begin{array}{c}34 \\\\ 34-2 k\\end{array}\\right)$, it is enough to check this for $2 \\leq k \\leq 8$.

Again, there are plenty of factors of 5 , so it is enough to note that both terms are odd, because $\\left(\\begin{array}{l}34 \\\\ 32\\end{array}\\right)=\\frac{34 \\cdot 33}{1 \\cdot 2}=$ $17 \\cdot 33$.\n\nThanks to the initial factor of 2 in the expression for $N$ (outside the parentheses), the previous paragraphs show that $N \\equiv 2\\left(3^{34}+\\left(\\begin{array}{c}34 \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right) 3^{32} \\cdot 5\\right)-1(\\bmod 100)$.\n\nNow consider the powers of 3 .

There are two intersection points of that circle with $l$, one on each arc with endpoints $B$ and $C$; label the one on the major arc $P_{2}$ and on the minor $\\operatorname{arc} P_{3}$. Finally, if $P B=A B$, then $P B=A C$ by the transitive property and $P C=A C$ by the perpendicular bisector theorem, so $P B A C$ is a rhombus; $P$ is the reflection of $A$ across $\\overline{B C}$.

Now $\\odot A$ and $\\odot B$ intersect at two points, but one of them is $C$, so the other intersection must be the location of $P$, which is $P_{5}$. The condition $P B=A B$ is impossible, because it implies that $A B=B C$, which is false because in $\\triangle A B C, \\mathrm{~m} \\angle C>\\mathrm{m} \\angle A=20^{\\circ}$, so $A B>B C$. The third possibility for $\\triangle P A B$ is that $P A=P B$, implying that the perpendicular bisector of $\\overline{A B}$ intersects $\\odot B$, which only occurs if $B C / A B \\geq 1 / 2$ (although if $B C / A B=1 / 2$, the triangle is degenerate).

Then $g$ is periodic, because $g(x+3)=f(x)+10-\\frac{10 x}{3}-\\frac{10 \\cdot 3}{3}=g(x)$. The graph of $g$ is shown below:\n\n<img_3987>\n\nBecause $g(x)$ is the (vertical) distance between the graph of $y=f(x)$ and the line $y=\\frac{10}{3} x$, the fact that $g$ is periodic implies that $f$ always stays within some fixed distance $D$ of the line $y=\\frac{10}{3} x$. On the other hand, because $\\frac{10}{3}>\\sqrt{11}$, the graph of $y=\\frac{10}{3} x$ gets further and further away from the graph of $y=\\sqrt{11} x$ as $x$ increases. Because the graph of $y=f(x)$ remains near $y=\\frac{10}{3} x$, the graph of $y=f(x)$ drifts upward from the line $y=\\sqrt{11} x$.\n\nFor each integer $n$, define the open interval $I_{n}=\\left(\\frac{n-1}{3}, \\frac{n}{3}\\right)$. In fact, $f$ is constant on $I_{n}$, as the following argument shows. For $x \\in I_{n}, \\frac{n}{9}-\\frac{1}{9}<\\frac{x}{3}<\\frac{n}{9}$. Because $n$ is an integer, there are no integers between $\\frac{n}{9}-\\frac{1}{9}$ and $\\frac{n}{9}$, so $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{x}{3}\\right\\rfloor$ is constant; similarly, $\\lceil 3 x\\rceil$ is constant on the same intervals. Let $l_{n}$ be the value of $f$ on the interval $I_{n}$, and let $L_{n}=f\\left(\\frac{n}{3}\\right)$, the value at the right end of the interval $I_{n}$. If $n$ is not a multiple of 9 , then $l_{n}=L_{n}$, because as $x$ increases from $n-\\varepsilon$ to $n$, the floor function does not increase. This means that $f$ is actually constant on the half-closed interval $\\left(\\frac{n-1}{3}, \\frac{n}{3}\\right]$. If neither $n$ nor $n+1$ are multiples of 9 , then $l_{n+1}=l_{n}+1$. However if $n$ is a multiple of 9 , then $L_{n}=l_{n}+1$ and $l_{n+1}=L_{n}+1$. (The value of $f(x)$ increases when $x$ increases from $n-\\varepsilon$ to $n$, as well as going from $n$ to $n+\\varepsilon$.)\n\nHence on each interval of the form $(3 n-3,3 n)$, the graph of $f$ looks like 9 steps of height 1 and width $\\frac{1}{3}$, all open on the left and closed on the right except for the last step, which is open on both ends. Between the intervals $(3 n-3,3 n)$ and $(3 n, 3 n+3), f(x)$ increases by 2 , with $f(3 n)$ halfway between steps. This graph is shown below:\n\n\n\n<img_3187>\n\nOn each interval $(3 n-3,3 n)$, the average rate of change is $3<\\sqrt{11}$, so the steps move down relative $y=\\sqrt{11} x$ within each interval. At the end of each interval, the graph of $f$ rises relative to $y=\\sqrt{11} x$. Thus the last intersection point between $f(x)$ and $\\sqrt{11} x$ will be on the ninth step of one of these intervals. Suppose this intersection point lies in the interval $(3 k-3,3 k)$. The ninth step is of height $10 k-1$. Set $x=3 k-r$, where $r<\\frac{1}{3}$.

Therefore the equation $6 \\tan ^{-1} x+4 \\tan ^{-1}(3 x)=\\pi$ is equivalent to $z^{6} \\cdot w^{4}=a$, where $a$ is a real number (and, in fact, $a<0$ ). To simplify somewhat, we can take the square root of both sides, and get $z^{3} \\cdot w^{2}=0+b i$, where $b$ is a real number. Then $(1+x i)^{3}(1+3 x i)^{2}=$ $0+b i$.

This indicates that the values of $s$ \"interweave\" somewhat from one group of 10 to the next: the sets alternate between even and odd.

That is, $s$ takes on 100 distinct values over any range of the form $\\{100 y+0,100 y+1, \\ldots, 100 y+99\\}$.\n\nFirst determine how many values are repeated between consecutive hundreds. Let $y$ be an integer that is not a multiple of 10 . Then the largest value for $s(100 y+k)(0 \\leq k \\leq 99)$ is $100 y+(s(y)-y)+99+s(99)=100 y+s(y)-y+117$, whereas the smallest value in the next group of 100 is for\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ns(100(y+1)) & =100(y+1)+(s(y+1)-(y+1))=100 y+(s(y)+2)-(y+1)+100 \\\\\n& =100 y+s(y)-y+101\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThis result implies that the values for $s(100 y+91)$ through $s(100 y+99)$ match the values of $s(100 y+100)$ through $s(100 y+108)$. So there are 9 repeated values.\n\nNow determine how many values are repeated between consecutive thousands. Let $z$ be a digit, and consider $s(1000 z+999)$ versus $s(1000(z+1))$.

(Leading zeros are allowed, so $1=0001_{2}=0001_{5}$ is one such number.) Compute the remainder when the sum of the elements of $\\mathcal{S}$ is divided by 10,000.",

            "The remainders of an integer $N$ modulo $2^{4}=16$ and $5^{4}=625$ uniquely determine its remainder modulo 10000. There are only 16 strings of four 0's and 1's. In addition, because 16 and 625 are relatively prime, it will be shown below that for each such string $s$, there exists exactly one integer $x_{s}$ in the range $0 \\leq x_{s}<10000$ such that the base- 2 and base- 5 representations of $x_{s}$ end in the digits of $s$ (e.g., $x_{1001}$ is the unique positive integer less than 10000 such that $x$ 's base- 5 representation and base- 2 representation both end in 1001).\n\nHere is a proof of the preceding claim: Let $p(s)$ be the number whose digits in base 5 are the string $s$, and $b(s)$ be the number whose digits in base 2 are the string $s$. Then the system $x \\equiv$ $p(s) \\bmod 625$ and $x \\equiv b(s) \\bmod 16$ can be rewritten as $x=p(s)+625 m$ and $x=b(s)+16 n$ for integers $m$ and $n$. These reduce to the Diophantine equation $16 n-625 m=p(s)-b(s)$, which has solutions $m, n$ in $\\mathbb{Z}$, with at least one of $m, n \\geq 0$. Assuming without loss of generality that $m>0$ yields $x=p(s)+625 m \\geq 0$. To show that there exists an $x_{s}<10000$ and that it is unique, observe that the general form of the solution is $m^{\\prime}=m-16 t, n^{\\prime}=n+625 t$. Thus if $p(s)+625 m>10000$, an appropriate $t$ can be found by writing $0 \\leq p(s)+625(m-16 t)<10000$, which yields $p(s)+625 m-10000<10000 t \\leq p(s)+625 m$. Because there are exactly 10000 integers in that interval, exactly one of them is divisible by 10000 , so there is exactly one value of $t$ satisfying $0 \\leq p(s)+625(m-16 t)<10000$, and set $x_{s}=625(m-16 t)$.\n\nTherefore there will be 16 integers whose base- 2 and base- 5 representations end in the same four digits, possibly with leading 0 's as in the example. Let $X=x_{0000}+\\cdots+x_{1111}$. Then $X$ is congruent modulo 16 to $0000_{2}+\\cdots+1111_{2}=8 \\cdot\\left(1111_{2}\\right)=8 \\cdot 15 \\equiv 8$. Similarly, $X$ is congruent modulo 625 to $0000_{5}+\\cdots+1111_{5}=8 \\cdot 1111_{5}=2 \\cdot 4444_{5} \\equiv 2 \\cdot(-1)=-2$.\n\nSo $X$ must be $8(\\bmod 16)$ and $-2(\\bmod 625)$. Noticing that $625 \\equiv 1(\\bmod 16)$, conclude that the answer is $-2+10 \\cdot 625=\\mathbf{6 2 4 8}$."

Notice that if any of $A, B$, or $C$ is not a prime, at least two points are lost, and so all three numbers must be prime. Proceed by cases:\n\nFirst consider the case $A=2$. Then $1 \\underline{A}$ is composite, so all of $1 \\underline{B}, 1 \\underline{C}, \\underline{A} \\underline{B}, \\underline{A} \\underline{C}, \\underline{B} \\underline{C}$ must be prime. Considering now the values of $1 \\underline{B}$ and $1 \\underline{C}$, both $B$ and $C$ must be in the set $\\{3,7\\}$. Because 27 is composite, $B=C=3$, but then $\\underline{B} \\underline{C}=33$ is composite. So $A$ cannot equal 2 .\n\nIf $A=3$, then $B \\neq 2$ because both 12 and 32 are composite. If $B=3,1 \\underline{B}$ is prime but $\\underline{A} \\underline{B}=33$ is composite, so all of $C, 1 \\underline{C}$, and $3 \\underline{C}$ must be prime. These conditions are satisfied by $C=7$ and no other value. So $A=B=3$ and $C=7$, yielding $N=\\mathbf{1 0 0 3 3 7}$."

Because $k$ must be odd, $E(n, k)$ must be even. To show this, consider the case where $E(n, k)$ is odd. If $E(n, k)$ is odd, then an odd number of flips happen an odd number of times, resulting in an odd number of total flips. This is a contradiction because $n$ is even.\n\nCall a switch \"non-flipped\" in any given minute if it is not among the switches flipped in that minute. Because $E(n, k)$ (i.e., the total number of minutes) is even, and each switch is flipped an odd number of times, each switch must also be non-flipped an odd number of times. Therefore any sequence of flips that solves the \" $(n, k)$ puzzle\" can be made into a sequence of flips that solves the \" $(n, n-k)$ \" puzzle by interchanging flips and non-flips. These sequences last for the same number of minutes, and therefore $E(n, k)=E(n, n-k)$.\n\n$E(2020,1993)=76$. By the above prove, conclude that $E(2020,1993)=E(2020,27)$. Compute the latter instead. Because $\\frac{2020}{27}>74$, it will require at least 75 minutes to flip each switch once.

The digit 0 only occurs in the hundreds place if the thousands digit is 2 , so look at the numbers 1 through 1999. Each non-zero digit contributes an equal number of times, so there are 200 each of $1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9$. The same applies to the tens digit, except there can be the stray digit of 1 among the numbers 2010 through 2019, but again, these do not affect the product. In the units place, there are 202 of each of the digits. Altogether, there are 602 each of $2,3,4,6,7,8$, 9, along with 20 extra instances of the digit 2 .

To see this, note that if the first and last numbers in a lucky trio were both even, then exactly one of these numbers would be a multiple of 4 . But neither $2,3,4$ nor 4,5,6 is a lucky trio, and if a list of three consecutive integers contains a multiple of 4 that is greater than 4 , this number cannot be a semiprime.

In the first step, a characterization of the possible final morphed sequences is given. In the second step, a lower bound on the number of steps is given, and in the third step, it is shown that this bound can be achieved.\n\nStep 1. Note the following.\n\n- The sum of the elements of $T$ is $1^{2}+2^{2}+\\cdots+10^{2}=385$, and morphs are sum-preserving. So any morphed sequence has sum 385 and a mean of 38.5.\n- The sequence $T$ has positive integer terms, and morphs preserve this property. Thus any morphed sequence has positive integer terms.\n- The sequence $T$ is strictly increasing, and morphs preserve this property. Thus any morphed sequence is strictly increasing.\n\n\n\nNow if the morphed sequence is an arithmetic progression, it follows from the above three observations that it must have the form\n\n$$\n(38.5-4.5 d, 38.5-3.5 d, \\ldots, 38.5+4.5 d)\n$$\n\nwhere $d$ is an odd positive integer satisfying $38.5-4.5 d>0$.

Using the \"stars and bars\" approach, the number of nonnegative integral solutions to $a+b+c=T-1$ is the number of arrangements of $T-1$ stars and 2 bars in a row (the bars act has separators and the \" 2 \" arises because it is one less than the number of variables in the equation).

In this case, the number of terms that are not multiples of $p$ is the number of nonnegative integral solutions to the equation $b+c=T-1$, which is $T$ ( $b$ can range from 0 to $T-1$ inclusive, and then $c$ is fixed).

However, diametrically opposite sides are parallel, so (for example) the sides $s_{3}$ and $s_{11}$ cannot both be used. Thus none of $a, b, c$ may equal 8 . Taking $s_{0}$ as the first side, the second side would be $s_{0+a}=s_{a}$, and the third side would be $s_{a+b}$, with $c$ sides between $s_{a+b}$ and $s_{0}$. To eliminate reflections and rotations, specify additionally that $a \\geq b \\geq c$. The allowable partitions are in the table below.\n\n| $a$ | $b$ | $c$ | triangle |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| 12 | 2 | 2 | $s_{0} s_{12} s_{14}$ |\n| 11 | 3 | 2 | $s_{0} s_{11} s_{14}$ |\n| 10 | 4 | 2 | $s_{0} s_{10} s_{14}$ |\n| 10 | 3 | 3 | $s_{0} s_{10} s_{13}$ |\n| 9 | 5 | 2 | $s_{0} s_{9} s_{14}$ |\n| 9 | 4 | 3 | $s_{0} s_{9} s_{13}$ |\n| 7 | 7 | 2 | $s_{0} s_{7} s_{14}$ |\n| 7 | 6 | 3 | $s_{0} s_{7} s_{13}$ |\n| 7 | 5 | 4 | $s_{0} s_{7} s_{12}$ |\n| 6 | 6 | 4 | $s_{0} s_{6} s_{12}$ |\n| 6 | 5 | 5 | $s_{0} s_{6} s_{11}$ |\n\nThus there are $\\mathbf{1 1}$ distinct such triangles."

Depending on their values, the line $\\ell$ might intersect any two sides of the triangle or none at all. Each case\n\n\n\nrequires a separate computation. There are two cases where the computation is trivial. First, when $\\ell$ passes to the left of or through the leftmost vertex of $\\triangle P Q R$, which occurs when $A-1 \\leq \\min (B, 1)$, the probability is 1 . Second, when $\\ell$ passes to the right of or through the rightmost vertex of $\\triangle P Q R$, which occurs when $A-1 \\geq \\max (B, 17)$, the probability is 0 .

Then the desired probability is $[M Q R T] /[P Q R]=1-[P M T] /[P Q R]$. Since $\\triangle P M T \\sim \\triangle P X R$ and the areas of similar triangles are proportional to the squares of corresponding sides, $[P M T] /[P X R]=(P M / P X)^{2}$. Since $\\triangle P X R$ and $\\triangle P Q R$ both have height $X R$, their areas are proportional to their bases: $[P X R] /[P Q R]=P X / P Q$. Taking the product, $[P M T] /[P Q R]=(P M / P X)^{2}(P X / P Q)=$ $\\frac{P M^{2}}{P X \\cdot P Q}=\\frac{(A-2)^{2}}{(B-1)(17-1)}$, and the final answer is\n\n$$\n\\frac{[M Q R T]}{[P Q R]}=1-\\frac{[P M T]}{[P Q R]}=1-\\frac{(A-2)^{2}}{16(B-1)}\n$$\n\nCase 2: Let $U$ be the point of intersection of $\\ell$ and $\\overline{Q R}$.

Let $S$ be the point on $\\overline{P R}$ such that $\\overline{Q S} \\perp \\overline{P Q}$. Then $\\triangle T U R \\sim \\triangle S Q R$, so the areas of these two triangles are proportional to the squares of the corresponding altitudes $M X$ and $Q X$. Thinking of $\\overleftrightarrow{P R}$ as the common base, $\\triangle S Q R$ and $\\triangle P Q R$ have a common altitude, so the ratio of their areas is $S R / P R$. Since $\\triangle P Q S \\sim$ $\\triangle P X R, P S / P R=P Q / P X$ and so $\\frac{S R}{P R}=1-\\frac{P S}{P R}=1-\\frac{P Q}{P X}=\\frac{Q X}{P X}$. Therefore the desired probability is\n\n$$\n\\frac{[T U R]}{[P Q R]}=\\frac{[T U R]}{[S Q R]} \\cdot \\frac{[S Q R]}{[P Q R]}=\\left(\\frac{M X}{Q X}\\right)^{2} \\frac{Q X}{P X}=\\frac{(B-A+1)^{2}}{(B-17)(B-1)}\n$$\n\nUsing the answers from positions 7 and $9, A=4+1+4=9$ and $B=2+7=9$. The first case applies, so the probability is\n\n$$\n1-\\frac{(9-2)^{2}}{16(9-1)}=1-\\frac{49}{128}=\\frac{\\mathbf{7 9}}{\\mathbf{1 2 8}}\n$$"
